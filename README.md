# ChaptOS

Chapter operations platform — a single place to run any chapter-based organization. Tracks members, attendance, dues, GPA, service hours, deadlines, treasury and budget, party events, programming/events with prep checklists, Instagram content, community-service hours and participation, meeting notes, and a foldered chapter docs library, with a live activity log, a pinned announcement, and a weekly digest of what's on deck. Members join either by claiming a pre-seeded roster row or through an org invite link.

Each org self-configures to its own shape: an AI onboarding interview tailors the enabled pages, vocabulary, status thresholds, officer roles, **custom per-member fields**, and **custom org-defined metrics** to the kind of organization being set up — a sports team, a marching band, a volunteer group, or a fraternity all get a fitting starting setup rather than a chapter-only one.

Built as one operations dashboard with a dedicated, app-like mobile layout. Includes a tool-calling AI assistant ("Ask the Chapter") that answers questions and proposes write actions, backed by an offline eval harness for measuring answer quality.

Multi-org: each Organization is a fully isolated tenant. One Google account can belong to multiple orgs and switch between them via an `active_org_id` cookie.

## Highlights

A few things worth showing off:

- **Org-scoped DB wrapper with automatic tenancy injection.** `lib/db/tenant.ts` wraps every Prisma operation to inject `organizationId` automatically — services call `ctx.db.transaction.create(...)` and can't accidentally touch another org's data. `findUnique` is replaced by `findFirst + org filter`; updates and deletes run a verify-then-mutate pattern to preserve exact return types without needing composite unique constraints everywhere.
- **Three-tier auth: PlatformAdmin → OrgAdmin → Member.** `buildContext()` in `lib/context` resolves all three tiers per request, emits a typed `RequestContext`, and optionally gates on a specific permission or rate-limits the caller. Route handlers open with `buildContext()`, parse with Zod, call a service, and map errors with `toResponse()` — no `prisma.*` calls in `app/api/**`.
- **Side effects through events, never service-to-service calls.** Services call `emit(ctx, action, subject, metadata)` from `lib/events`. Reactions (recalcs, notifications, projections) live as `on(action, handler)` registrations in `lib/events/handlers/`. The event writer also dual-writes an `ActivityLog` row so the existing feed keeps working.
- **Tool-calling AI assistant with self-correcting validation.** Sixteen read tools + six write-proposal tools in one file ([lib/ai-tools.ts](lib/ai-tools.ts)) so schema and dispatcher can't drift. `validateArgs` walks the schema before dispatch — a wrong enum returns a structured error the model self-corrects on the next iteration.
- **AI onboarding interview that configures the org safely.** A founder describes their organization in plain language; a conversational agent ([app/api/ai/setup-chat/route.ts](app/api/ai/setup-chat/route.ts)) runs an adaptive interview and *proposes* a starting setup — enabled workflows, vocabulary overrides, status thresholds, officer roles, and custom member fields. Every id/key the model returns is intersected with the real registries in [validateRecommendation()](app/api/ai/recommend-setup/route.ts) before it can reach the client or be persisted, so a hallucinated workflow or permission can never leak through.
- **Org-defined custom fields and metrics.** Admins can add per-member fields (stored sparsely on `Brother.customFields`) and define their own KPIs (`OrgMetricDefinition` + `BrotherMetricValue`) with goal / watch / at-risk bands and an aggregation (`avg` / `sum` / `count_on_track`) — so a team can track "Jersey #" and a band can track "Section" without schema changes. Pure status/headline math lives in [lib/metrics.ts](lib/metrics.ts) and [lib/custom-member-fields.ts](lib/custom-member-fields.ts), importable from both server and client.
- **Offline eval harness.** Hand-written cases at [evals/ask-the-chapter/cases.jsonl](evals/ask-the-chapter/cases.jsonl) drive the same loop as the production route in-process, graded on tool selection, args, and final-answer substrings. Lets prompt and model changes be measured instead of vibes-checked.
- **Discord-style role system with permission bitfields.** Twelve named permissions ([lib/permissions.ts](lib/permissions.ts)) packed into a 32-bit int on each `Role`. A member's effective bits are the bitwise OR of every role they hold. Role hierarchy ranks prevent privilege escalation — a caller can only grant/edit roles strictly below their own highest rank.
- **Write proposals, never silent writes.** The AI's `propose_*` tools validate inputs server-side but never touch the database. The client renders a confirm card; only on user confirmation does it POST to the real `/api/*` route where `buildContext()` guards decide whether the write actually happens.
- **Structured server-side observability.** One JSON-per-line error log ([lib/observability.ts](lib/observability.ts)) with request IDs, route tags, and optional Sentry forwarding via a lazy dynamic import — no dependency cost until enabled.
- **Two ways into an org.** Admins can pre-seed roster rows that members claim by name, or share an `OrgInvite` link ([app/join/[token]/](app/join/%5Btoken%5D/)). Invites come in two modes: `open` mints a fresh `Brother` + `Membership` on redemption, `claim` routes the user into the existing name-match claim flow. Every redemption is recorded in `InviteRedemption`.
- **Soft deletes on financial data.** `Transaction` rows are never hard-deleted; `deletedAt` preserves history for audit and undo.
- **Foldered docs library with drag-and-drop.** The docs page groups pinned links into one-level `DocFolder`s (à la Google Drive) with drag-and-drop filing, a sort control (newest / name / kind), contributor attribution, and copy-link / refresh-preview card actions. Deleting a folder releases its docs back to the library root instead of cascading them away.
- **Admin-reorderable sidebar.** Admins can reorder the nav pages within each group; the chosen order persists to `OrganizationConfig.navOrder` as a sparse, advisory list of nav labels. The sidebar sorts each group by it and appends anything not listed, so a hidden page keeps its slot and re-enabling it lands back where the admin put it ([lib/nav-order.ts](lib/nav-order.ts)).
- **CSS-only responsiveness.** Desktop and mobile dashboards are sibling trees toggled with Tailwind breakpoints — no JS viewport detection, no layout flash on hydration.

**Key design decisions:**

- **Route handlers are thin controllers.** Open with `buildContext()` from `@/lib/context`, parse with a Zod schema from `@/lib/validation`, call a service from `@/lib/services`, map errors with `toResponse()` from `@/lib/errors`. No `prisma.*` or raw `db()` calls in `app/api/**` outside the auth bootstrap routes.
- **Side effects flow through events.** Services call `emit(ctx, action, subject, metadata)` from `@/lib/events`. Reactions live as `on(action, handler)` registrations in `lib/events/handlers/`. Never call another service from inside a service — emit an event.
- **Three-layer identity.** Supabase manages OAuth sessions; `Brother` holds per-org profile data; `Membership` links the two and carries the org-admin flag. A signed-in user has no access until their Google account is linked to a `Brother` row within an org.
- **Global state via `ChapterContext`.** All chapter data is fetched once on mount in `ChapterProvider` and shared app-wide. Pages do optimistic updates against context instead of refetching.
- **All DB access through API routes.** Client components never touch Prisma. Every mutation goes through an API route that resolves `buildContext()` before touching the database.
- **Persistent avatars.** Custom profile photos are stored in Supabase Storage and the URL is persisted on `Brother.avatarUrl`. That column — not the volatile Supabase auth metadata — is the source of truth.
- **CSS-only responsiveness.** The desktop and mobile dashboards are sibling trees toggled purely with Tailwind breakpoints (`md:hidden` / `hidden md:block`). The mobile dashboard is a tabbed layout: **Overview · Tasks · Money · Brothers · Logs**.
- **Rate-limited mutations.** A simple in-memory limiter ([lib/rate-limit.ts](lib/rate-limit.ts)) caps mutations and AI chat turns per member per minute.

---

## Tenancy Model

Every organization is a fully isolated tenant. The enforcement layers, from outermost to innermost:

1. **Active-org cookie.** `proxy.ts` reads the `active_org_id` cookie on every request and the resolved org flows into `requireUser()`.
2. **`buildContext()`** resolves the `RequestContext` for the request, which includes `ctx.orgId` and an org-scoped `ctx.db` instance. Route handlers never resolve org context themselves.
3. **`ctx.db` (org-scoped wrapper).** `lib/db/tenant.ts` wraps every Prisma model to inject `organizationId` on all reads and writes automatically. `findUnique` is silently promoted to `findFirst + org filter`; updates and deletes use a verify-then-mutate pattern to avoid needing `@@unique([id, organizationId])` on every model.
4. **Postgres RLS.** Row-level security policies are the DB-layer backstop. As of Phase 4, `allow_all` permissive policies have been dropped on all org-scoped tables; only `org_isolation` (`organizationId = app.org_id`) remains. `RLS_SET_ORG_ID=1` must be set in every env — `db()` issues `SET LOCAL app.org_id` on every scoped query. Bootstrap paths (claim, redeem-invite, provisionOrg) run as `prismaPrivileged` (BYPASSRLS via `DIRECT_URL`) and are unaffected. To revert to permissive, apply `prisma/migrations/20260622000002_phase4_revert_allow_all/migration.sql` directly.

Every write must go through `ctx.db.<model>` (org-scoped) or carry an explicit `organizationId` in the data. Tenancy tests in `tests/tenancy/` guard this invariant.

**Multi-org membership.** A single `Brother` (Google identity) can hold `Membership` rows in multiple orgs. The `active_org_id` cookie selects which org's data the current session operates on. Switching orgs updates the cookie.

## AI Features

Four AI surfaces, all server-side behind auth, all dormant when `OPENAI_API_KEY` is unset:

### Ask the Chapter — tool-calling assistant
[app/api/ai/chat/route.ts](app/api/ai/chat/route.ts) · [app/components/ChatWidget.tsx](app/components/ChatWidget.tsx)

A floating chat widget that answers ad-hoc questions about chapter state — *"who has the worst attendance?"*, *"how much have we spent on Party Supplies?"*, *"add a deadline for next Friday"* — by calling tools instead of inventing answers.

**How it's built:**
- **Twenty-two tools** declared in [lib/ai-tools.ts](lib/ai-tools.ts): 16 read tools and 6 write-proposal tools. The schemas the model sees and the dispatcher that runs the tools live in the same file so they can't drift.
- **Scoped to the authenticated org.** The system prompt and all tool data are bounded to `ctx.orgId`. The assistant can't read or propose writes against another org's data.
- **Server-Sent Events streaming** with a Node-runtime endpoint, custom SSE framing, and a 10-iteration tool-call loop that lets the model chain queries.
- **Parallel tool calls.** When the model emits multiple calls in one turn, the server runs them concurrently via `Promise.all`.
- **Schema-validated args** (`validateArgs`). Wrong enums return a structured error the model self-corrects on the next iteration.
- **Writes are proposals, not executions.** `propose_*` tools validate inputs but never write — the client renders a confirm card and POSTs to the real route on user confirmation. `buildContext()` guards still decide whether the write happens.
- **Date context injected at prompt build time** ([lib/ai-prompt.ts](lib/ai-prompt.ts)): today's date + weekday, week bounds, last chapter-meeting date, active semester.
- **History trimmed before send.** Last 12 turns, prior messages capped at 600 chars.

### Onboarding interview — conversational org setup
[app/api/ai/setup-chat/route.ts](app/api/ai/setup-chat/route.ts) · [app/api/ai/recommend-setup/route.ts](app/api/ai/recommend-setup/route.ts) · [app/[slug]/onboarding/page.tsx](app/%5Bslug%5D/onboarding/page.tsx)

Right after creating an org, the founder describes it in plain language and an adaptive agent interviews them (a handful of questions, capped server-side) before proposing a complete starting setup: which workflow pages to enable, vocabulary overrides (e.g. *Member → Player*, *Period → Season*), member-status thresholds, 2–4 officer roles with permission bitfields, and 2–4 custom member fields.

**How it's built:**
- **Same SSE posture as the chat route** (`requireUser` → `aiEnabled` → `checkMutationRate`) with one tool, `emit_setup_proposal`, whose arguments mirror the single-shot `recommend-setup` schema so one validator handles both paths.
- **Proposes, never writes.** The model's output is untrusted: `validateRecommendation()` intersects every workflow id, vocab key, threshold, permission name, and field type with the real registries before it leaves the route. The founder confirms in the UI, and the apply step saves through the existing admin-gated `PATCH /api/orgs/config`.
- **Org-type priors.** [lib/org-types.ts](lib/org-types.ts) seeds a sensible preset per org type, so the flow still works (and falls back gracefully) when AI is disabled or the model errors.

### Weekly digest narration
[app/api/ai/digest/route.ts](app/api/ai/digest/route.ts)

One short sentence summarizing this week's deadlines, IG tasks, mandatory events, parties, and at-risk members. Heavily cached: in-memory by content hash on the server, plus per-key localStorage on the client. Falls back gracefully when AI is disabled.

### Meeting-notes summarization
[app/api/ai/summarize-meeting/route.ts](app/api/ai/summarize-meeting/route.ts)

On-demand summary of free-form chapter-meeting notes into Decisions / Action items / Discussed sections. Summary + content hash persist on the `CalendarEvent` row so a re-render doesn't re-summarize, but a content change does.

### Eval harness
[evals/ask-the-chapter/cases.jsonl](evals/ask-the-chapter/cases.jsonl) · [scripts/eval-ask-the-chapter.ts](scripts/eval-ask-the-chapter.ts)

Offline pass/fail harness for the chat feature. Drives the same tool-calling loop as the production route in-process (no HTTP, no SSE), against the live seeded DB. Grades each case on tool selection, args, and final-answer substrings. Cases run concurrently (4 at a time).

```
[PASS] super-attendance-worst (1820ms, 2 iter)
[FAIL] deadlines-empty-broaden (2410ms, 2 iter)

## Roles & Access

Access is controlled by three orthogonal tiers.

### Auth tiers (checked in order)

| Tier | What it does |
|------|--------------|
| **`PlatformAdmin`** | Cross-org superuser. A separate `PlatformAdmin` table row, not a flag on `Brother`. All permission bits set. Can operate on any org via the active-org cookie. All actions are auditable. |
| **`isOrgAdmin = true`** on `Membership` | Per-org admin. All permission bits set within the active org only. Switching to a different org yields a regular member context. Does not bypass rate limiting. |
| *Regular member* | Permission bitfield from assigned `BrotherRole` rows. No elevated bits. |

`buildContext()` resolves these tiers per request and exposes `ctx.isPlatformAdmin` and `ctx.isOrgAdmin`.

### Identity flags on `Brother`

| Flag | What it does |
|------|--------------|
| **`isAdmin = true`** | Legacy superuser flag. Still present in schema for backcompat; new code should use `Membership.isOrgAdmin` instead. |
| **`isGhost = true`** | Full member-level read access, but hidden from every member listing, count, and attendance enrollment — an observer (e.g. an alumnus) with no footprint. Provisioned via the "Atomic Samurai" claim name; never granted admin. |

### Permission flags ([lib/permissions.ts](lib/permissions.ts))

Twelve named permissions packed into a 32-bit bitfield on each `Role`:

```
MANAGE_BROTHERS  MANAGE_TREASURY  MANAGE_EVENTS       MANAGE_PARTIES   MANAGE_INSTAGRAM
MANAGE_SERVICE   MANAGE_ATTENDANCE  MANAGE_SEMESTERS  MANAGE_ROLES     MANAGE_DOCS
MANAGE_ANNOUNCEMENTS  MANAGE_SETTINGS
```

`MANAGE_SETTINGS` covers org config + invite links, kept distinct from `MANAGE_BROTHERS` (roster CRUD) so settings authority isn't bundled with roster editing.

A member's *effective* bitfield is the bitwise OR of every role they hold. UI surfaces and API routes both check the same `hasPermission(bits, "MANAGE_X")` helper.

### Roles

Each role bundles a name, optional color chip, a permission bitfield, and a hierarchy `rank`. Seeded system roles (e.g. **President** with all permissions) are protected from rename/delete. Custom roles are managed from **Settings → Roles** by anyone with `MANAGE_ROLES`.

**Hierarchy guard:** a caller can only grant, edit, or revoke roles whose `rank` is *strictly less* than their own highest assigned role's rank.

## Auth Flow

```
1. User visits any protected page
        │
        ▼
2. proxy.ts checks for a valid Supabase session cookie
        │
        ├── No session ──────────────────────────────────► /login
        │
        └── Session present ──────────────────────────────► pass through (refreshed cookie)
                │
                ▼
   [slug] layout gates link/membership status (proxy no longer does):
        ├── Member of <slug> ─────────────────────────────► render org dashboard
        ├── Signed in, no Brother linked ─────────────────► /pending-access
        └── Linked, but not a member of <slug> ───────────► access-denied (or /welcome if zero memberships)
                │
                ▼
3. /login — "Continue with Google" → Supabase OAuth
        │
        ▼
4. /auth/callback — exchanges code for session, checks Brother + Membership tables
        │
        ├── Membership found for this authUserId + org → set active_org_id cookie → /
        │
        └── No Membership yet → /pending-access
                │
                ▼
5. User types their name → POST /api/auth/claim
        │
        ├── Name matches one unclaimed Brother row → link it, create Membership
        └── Name is "Atomic Samurai" → provision a hidden ghost row (full access, no footprint)
                │
                ▼
6. authUserId written to the Brother row, Membership created
        → set active_org_id cookie → /
```

> **Note:** Link status is the DB's truth, resolved by `requireUser()` in the pages/layouts that need it — there is no `brother_linked` cookie. (A legacy `brother_linked` cookie was removed; signout/unlink only *expire* it to clean up sessions carried across that deploy.) The `[slug]` layout gates an authenticated-but-unlinked user into the claim flow.

**Admin workflow:** add a `Brother` row from the Brothers page **before** the person signs in. They claim it themselves on first login by entering their name exactly. Alternatively, share an invite link (**Settings → Invites**) — an `open`-mode link creates a member on redemption, a `claim`-mode link drops the user into the name-match claim flow above.

## Database Schema

Defined in [prisma/schema.prisma](prisma/schema.prisma). Highlights:

### Organization
The tenant root. Every domain row carries an `organizationId` FK here. `slug` is unique and used for org routing.

### Membership
Links a `Brother` to an `Organization`. `isOrgAdmin` grants all permission bits within that org. One `Brother` can have many `Membership` rows (multi-org).

### PlatformAdmin
A separate table (not a flag on `Brother`) for cross-org superusers. One row per platform staff member.

### Brother
| Column | Type | Notes |
|--------|------|-------|
| id | Int | PK |
| organizationId | Int | FK → Organization |
| name | String | |
| role | String | e.g. "President · Rush" |
| attendance | Float | 0–100, system-managed |
| duesOwed | Float | |
| gpa | Float | |
| serviceHours | Float | |
| authUserId | String? | Supabase user UUID, set on claim (unique) |
| avatarUrl | String? | Custom profile photo (source of truth) |
| email | String? | Cached from the session |
| isAdmin | Boolean | Legacy flag; prefer `Membership.isOrgAdmin` in new code |
| isGhost | Boolean | Hidden observer — excluded from all listings/counts |
| customFields | Json | Sparse `{ fieldId → value }` map for org-defined member fields |
| roles | BrotherRole[] | Many-to-many join to `Role` |
| memberships | Membership[] | Orgs this brother belongs to |
| metricValues | BrotherMetricValue[] | Per-member values for custom org metrics |

### Role / BrotherRole
`Role` is a named bundle of permission bits with a hierarchy `rank` and optional UI `color`. `permissions` is a 32-bit integer; meanings are defined in [lib/permissions.ts](lib/permissions.ts). `isSystem = true` protects seeded roles from rename/delete. `BrotherRole` is the join table — a member's effective permissions are the bitwise OR of every role they hold.

### OrgMetricDefinition / BrotherMetricValue
Org-defined custom KPIs. `OrgMetricDefinition` carries a `slug` (immutable after create), display `name`, optional `unit`, a per-member `goal`, `atRiskBelow` / optional `watchBelow` bands, and an `aggregation` (`avg` / `sum` / `count_on_track`) used to compute the dashboard headline. `BrotherMetricValue` holds one member's value for one definition (`organizationId` denormalized for tenant scoping). Status/headline math is pure and lives in [lib/metrics.ts](lib/metrics.ts). Custom **member fields** (lighter-weight, free-text/number/select) are not separate tables — definitions live on `OrganizationConfig.customMemberFields` (JSON) and values sparsely on `Brother.customFields` (JSON); see [lib/custom-member-fields.ts](lib/custom-member-fields.ts).

### OperationalEvent
Structured audit log. Every meaningful state change emitted by a service lands here (`action`, `subjectType`, `subjectId`, `actorId`, `orgId`, `metadata` JSON). Drives reactions via the event handler registry and dual-writes to `ActivityLog` for the UI feed.

### CalendarEvent
Chapter events: `title`, `date`, optional `time`, `category`, `mandatory`, `description` (doubles as meeting notes), `location`, plus `notesSummary` + `notesSummaryAt` for AI-generated summaries.

### ProgrammingEvent / ProgrammingChecklistItem / ProgrammingEventDoc
The events/programming planner. A `ProgrammingEvent` starts life as an idea (`stage = "idea"`) holding its own planning fields, and is linked one-to-one to a `CalendarEvent` (`calendarEventId`) only once it leaves the idea stage. Carries prep/ops fields — `owner`, `collabOrg`, `roomStatus`, `flyerPosted`, `socialsMeeting`, `spendingCents` — plus post-event `successRating` and `wrapUpNotes`. `ProgrammingChecklistItem` rows are the ordered prep checklist; `ProgrammingEventDoc` links attached docs.

### ServiceParticipation
Per-member attendance for a `ServiceEvent` — who actually showed up, used to credit service hours.

### OrgInvite / InviteRedemption
Org invite links. `OrgInvite` carries a unique `token`, a `mode` (`open` mints a new member on redemption, `claim` routes into the name-match claim flow), and optional `expiresAt` / `revokedAt`. `InviteRedemption` records each use.

### AttendanceRecord / AttendanceExcuse
`AttendanceRecord` links a `Brother` to a `CalendarEvent` in a `Semester` with an `attended` flag. `AttendanceExcuse` records an approved/pending excuse; approved excuses don't count against attendance.

### Semester
`label` (unique per org, e.g. `SPR26`), `startDate`, `endDate`, `isActive` (one active at a time per org).

### Transaction
Treasury entries with `type` (`income`/`expense`), `category`, `amount`, `paymentMethod`. Soft-deleted via `deletedAt`.

### Budget / BudgetAllocation
Per-semester budget (`carryoverBalance`, `reserveAmount`) with line-item `allocations`.

### Doc / DocFolder
`Doc` is a pinned chapter link with cached OG metadata (`title`, favicon, `embedOk`) and an optional `folderId`. `DocFolder` is a flat, one-level folder for grouping docs on the `/docs` page. Deleting a folder releases its docs back to the library root (sets `folderId = null`) rather than cascading them away.

### PartyEvent / ServiceEvent / InstagramTask / Deadline / ChapterAnnouncement / ActivityLog
See [prisma/schema.prisma](prisma/schema.prisma) for full field lists. All carry `organizationId`.

## Environment Variables

Copy `.env.example` to `.env.local` and fill in the values:

```bash
cp .env.example .env.local
```

| Variable | Required | Description |
|----------|----------|-------------|
| `DATABASE_URL` | Yes | Runtime Postgres connection. Use the Supabase **pooled** URL (PgBouncer, port 6543). |
| `DIRECT_URL` | Recommended | A **direct** session connection (port 5432) used by Prisma CLI commands (`migrate`, `db seed`). Migrations hang over the pooled URL because PgBouncer doesn't support DDL/advisory locks. `prisma.config.ts` falls back to `DATABASE_URL` if unset. |
| `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL` | Yes | Your Supabase project URL. |
| `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY` | Yes | Supabase anon/public key. |
| `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY` | Optional | Server-only. Enables admin reads of auth metadata. Never expose to the client. |
| `NEXT_PUBLIC_ROOT_DOMAIN` | Optional | Bare apex for org subdomain routing (e.g. `example.com`); org slugs resolve as `<slug>.<root>`. Defaults to `localhost` ([lib/domains.ts](lib/domains.ts)). |
| `NEXT_PUBLIC_DOMAIN_ALIASES` | Optional | Comma-separated extra apexes that should also resolve org subdomains. |
| `NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_NAME` | Optional | Display name for the wordmark/footer. Defaults to `ChaptOS`. |
| `OPENAI_API_KEY` | Optional | Enables AI features (chat, digest narration, meeting summaries). All three degrade gracefully when unset. |
| `RLS_SET_ORG_ID` | Yes | Must be `1` in every env. Causes `db()` to issue `SET LOCAL app.org_id` on every scoped query, which Postgres RLS uses to enforce tenant isolation. |
| `SENTRY_DSN` | Optional | When set, `logError` forwards to Sentry via a lazy dynamic import. No dependency cost when unset. |

**Where to find these in Supabase:**
- `DATABASE_URL` / `DIRECT_URL`: Project Settings → Database → Connection string (pooled = port 6543, direct/session = port 5432).
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL`, `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`, `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY`: Project Settings → API.

> The runtime client connects through its own `pg.Pool` reading `DATABASE_URL` ([lib/prisma.ts](lib/prisma.ts)); the Prisma CLI uses the URL in `prisma.config.ts`. Never expose `DATABASE_URL` to the client.

---

## Local Setup

### Prerequisites
- Node.js 20+
- A Supabase project with Google OAuth enabled

### Steps

**1. Clone and install**
```bash
git clone <repo-url>
cd figurints
npm install        # postinstall runs `prisma generate`
```

**2. Configure environment**
```bash
cp .env.example .env.local
# Edit .env.local with your Supabase credentials
```

**3. Enable Google OAuth in Supabase**
Authentication → Providers → Google → enable and add your Google OAuth credentials.
Add the redirect URL: `http://localhost:3000/auth/callback`

**4. Run migrations** (uses `DIRECT_URL`)
```bash
npx prisma migrate deploy
```

**5. Generate the Prisma client** (also runs on install/build)
```bash
npx prisma generate
```
Output goes to `app/generated/prisma/` (gitignored — generated locally and in CI).

**6. Enable profile photos (optional)**
Run the SQL in `supabase/` to create the `avatars` storage bucket and its RLS policies.

**7. Seed sample data (optional)**
```bash
npx prisma db seed
```

**8. Start the dev server**
```bash
npm run dev
```
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000), sign in with Google, then claim your member row on `/pending-access`.

**9. (Optional) Run the AI eval harness**
With `OPENAI_API_KEY` set and the DB seeded:
```bash
npx tsx scripts/eval-ask-the-chapter.ts
```
See [evals/ask-the-chapter/README.md](evals/ask-the-chapter/README.md) for the case schema and how to add new cases.

## Deployment

Built for **Vercel** with a Supabase backend.

1. **Import the repository** in Vercel.
2. **Add environment variables** (Project Settings → Environment Variables): `DATABASE_URL`, `DIRECT_URL`, `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL`, `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`, `RLS_SET_ORG_ID=1` (and `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY`, `OPENAI_API_KEY`, `SENTRY_DSN` if used).
3. **Add the production redirect URL** in Supabase → Authentication → URL Configuration → Redirect URLs:
   ```
   https://your-app.vercel.app/auth/callback
   ```
4. **Deploy.** The `build` script runs `prisma generate && next build` on each push to `main`.

> **Migrations are not run by the build.** Apply schema changes with `npx prisma migrate deploy` against the production database (locally with prod `DIRECT_URL`, or via your CI/pipeline) — otherwise new columns won't exist and queries will error.

> **Connection pooling.** Use the pooled URL (port 6543) for `DATABASE_URL` so short-lived Vercel functions don't exhaust connections, and the direct URL (port 5432) for `DIRECT_URL` so migrations work.

### Post-deploy checklist
- [ ] All env vars set in Vercel
- [ ] Production redirect URL added in Supabase Auth
- [ ] `npx prisma migrate deploy` run against the production database
- [ ] `avatars` storage bucket + policies created (if using profile photos)
- [ ] At least one `Organization` row and one `Brother` row exist (or seed them) so the first user can claim
- [ ] (If using AI) `OPENAI_API_KEY` set; verify the chat widget appears
